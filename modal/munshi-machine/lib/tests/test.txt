 Oooh, Mark, it's done. You're a good feeling about your own? Yes. I get these vibes for a little. I want to really wake up on a 2021 side of the bed one day. You're like, you know what? Time's for good, that's it. You caused cataclysmic damage that needed to get out of the room at some point, but while it was up, it was all good. Did I really need to keep putting it down again? Let's take this F-O-O-C-U off. I'm going to place this story around and figure out the start to eat with a parent. Welcome to Season 11, Episode 8 of Acquired, the podcast about great technology companies for the stories and playbooks behind them. I'm Ben Gilbert, and I am the co-founder and managing director of Snell-based Pioneer Square Labs and our venture fund, PSL Ventures. And I'm David Roethlipal, and I'm an angel investor based in CITCISCO. And we are your hosts. Today we are telling the entire history and strategy of Stratechery, and we are joined by the man himself, Ben Collinson, on the eve of Stratechery's 10-year anniversary. Stratechery is initially billed on his website as the business strategy and impact of technology. Sertekry, as Ben puts it, started as some guy in Taiwan with no access. Today, Sertekry is a powerhouse, shaping the thoughts and conversation of the entire technology industry around the world at the highest levels. Ben has interviewed Mark Zuckerberg, Jensen Huang, Satya Nadella, Sundar Gichai, Rich Barton, Meredith Copit-Legman of New York Times, Pat Delsinger of Intel, and John Collison, and many, many more. Many of which are regular readers. He is the father of aggregation theory, the most important business framework developed in the last 20 years. And Ben has pioneered the internet subscription newsletter business model. We sat down with him to talk about a bunch of his recent changes going big into podcasting, bringing on co-hosts at Expanding the Empire, and even now launching a spectacular software that he does not appear on at all. Regardless of what your business model is, regardless of what he's almost like what his content is, I don't think there's any creator, certainly not any business creator out there today, who doesn't directly or indirectly look to Ben and say, you're advising, you take the way for what I do. And you certainly feel that way, I feel that way. David, I didn't feel like your and to be a little bit more. was for launching the Fundrise Innovation Fund. So technology will disrupt every sector, including venture capital. I don't believe any VC would argue they're immune. It's happening to commerce, happening to news, entertainment, public markets, et cetera. But just like every other incumbent, they may have trouble imagining it. So the mission of our company, Fundrise, is bring about that sea change. So how do we do it? So in my experience, what happens is an industry enters, and the stories it tells itself, which were once true, become no longer true. You found this point out in your update. Yeah. So typically in the financial industry, the essential story is about alpha. You can come to raise money and create alpha. And that alpha is usually about deal-picking, making the best investments. And in other financial markets, for example, public markets, technology made those markets more transparent and more efficient over time, and that alpha went away. And Van Gogh basically consistently beat the best hedge funds in the world. So that's going to have a venture capital. It'll start where they were starting, which is mid to late stage companies where there is a lot more data. And that's what we're doing. The Fundraise Innovations Fund is a public mutual fund. It's like a Vanguard for the private technology markets. And so if I can paraphrase, it's less about picking the winners to guarantee alpha, but more about increasing transparency and access so that more investors can get the benefit of beta, these correlated returns where when the market goes up, you're invested in that asset class that you get to go up with. And you've indexed into cloud from 2012 to 2017, and you just said, I'm going to find data that indicates the top 10% or 20% of companies with product market set, you would have known great. I learned this in 2008. The cycle and the market is way more powerful than the individual. You think you're adding alpha, but you're actually riding these mega trends. And here's what's going to happen to venture. For sure, it's inevitable. Happens to every sector. I just want to be the one helping do it. And for Founders, once you're at that stage, the actual natural best fit and form of capital for you is the equivalent of mutual fund public market capital. And that's what you're bringing for the third time to the industry. Right, exactly. All thanks to Fundrise. If you want to join the over 350,000 individuals investing with Fundrise, you can click the link in the show notes. And if you're a founder and you want to get in touch about having the Innovation Fund participate in your nice funding round, email notvc, that's notvc, at fundrise.com. After the past, come hang out with the other 13,000 smart, thoughtful members of the Aquired community at Aquired.fm slash Slack. We'll all be talking about it. Without further ado, this is not investment advice. This show is for informational and entertainment purposes only. And now, on to our interview with Ben. Ben Thompson, welcome to Aquired. Thank you. Happy to be be here. Stay tuned with us. We've done surveys over the years of our audience saying, what is the number one topic that you'd want to see a photographer or who we have on the show and your name comes out many, many times, so I'm excited to be doing that. You'll probably know number one. Now there's a bit of a rust on going on. We asked you the number one ones and you were very high in the rankings. Well we have another number one though that is Jane Nandita has been checking his email today and he sent me a new new server text. It was very sweet and it's the first email between us and it was a down-to-date. Okay fine I'll take that. David and I I think that drew until we're talking about Uber and it was your your Don't Blame Uber piece from 2014. Yeah, well, it's kind of interesting in retrospect to think about that. I think that was about healthcare and rights and workers and things on those lines. It's pretty interesting. You could probably write a similar piece about easy money and the macro economic environment and lots of pieces. So, I mean, it's funny. I haven't thought about that piece in years and years. I usually have a very good memory of everything that I've written, but every now and then I will encounter a piece where there's someone linked to it or I'll come up when I'm searching for another number of users of every search. You felt that for yourself. I completely forgot that I wrote about that. Usually I would go back and read, like, oh, that wasn't bad. Sometimes I go back, like, I don't know about that one. But, you know, it is what happens if you've written thousands of posts over approaching 10 years now. It's just prolific. It's interesting. I went back in the early days to train for this. You'd post the importance on a Tumblr in 2009 that are all the way back in that catalog. Yeah, I've started multiple blogs through the years. I thought they were relevant and interesting. And also, I think it's useful to have a back catalog when you launch. And that's something that I do when I launch podcasts now is it's important to sort of establish the first time someone encounters you that this isn't just a flash in the pan sort of thing. It's something that is interesting. Do you like doing 30 episodes of Dittering before you release a single one? You know, in that case, we really wanted to figure out what that podcast should be. And then also, working with John, he can be a bit of perfectionist, so I took a set line to the West Metal team just thought he wanted it to. You guys, I don't know anybody else like that. There was a technical component that limited that as well. But I think it's good for both sides. It's good for the creator because if you can't have the discipline and sort of stamina to build up a back catalog, you're probably not going to have the discipline and stamina to keep going for a long time. So it's almost good internally to sort of get that done. But then also when someone encounters it and then they feel, wow, there's an excitement. That's just an anticipation of new episodes that will be down the road. But, wow, there's already a whole bunch of stuff here for me to listen to. He's got the first one, he's listened to a second one. And I think that sort of second one is super important. This is a point I made about writing in general. Anyone can come up with one it's evidence of that. And I think that's really important to online businesses in general. I think about that element a lot. I also think about every piece of content you create as a turn opportunity. Given I regularly look at each other's mid-episode and we're like okay, is this a required quality, or is it actually net negative for us for a week this episode because we've now reduced the average quality of a thing that someone comes to expect from us? Yeah, I mean, well, based on the question on me, right up there, I've got to say this is interesting. But it's interesting because I would push back against that a little bit. And this is why the consistency part is important. I mean, there's an ongoing discussion. I think there's that new social network post news or something. I just saw a thing on Twitter. I didn't actually follow through. But they want to do micropayments for articles, which I think are terrible. And there is a tendency in a lot of things to get overly indexed on the consumer, which kind of sounds wrong. Why wouldn't you have to give the consumer exactly what they want? But just to take the most obvious example, if a creator is not making money, well, the consumer may get what they want, which is free content, but they're not going to get it for very long. There is a short-term perspective versus a long-term perspective, which, well, no, by charging for this, I can do this over the long run. But from a microtransaction perspective, I think one of the issues is to create the piece of content is very time-consuming. And then, obviously, you get the free distribution on the back end. You have zero marginal cost on the back end. But the problem is you have a tiny mismatch with microtransactions between when the payment, later when the investment is made. And so, you want to put a lot of time into an article and then hope it gets traction so I can not just make money but also repay what I'm doing from there. And I think that the way to think about publishing online is what are you selling? I think when you get in the trap of thinking you're selling a single episode or selling a single article, that's actually getting the incentives along. What I'm selling to my subscribers is consistency and, yes, certainly a quality bar. When I write something that I'm not happy with, I'm miserable for the next 24 hours. Or if it's the end of the week, I have to wait until next week, and that really sucks. Because I certainly have the drive and compulsion to make sure that what I put out is high quality. But at the same time, there's an aspect of what I'm actually selling to my subscribers, and this is more of an implicit promise, but I think it's the reality, is the consistency and the regularity and the knowing that if something happens, you're going to be able to get my take on it. And I think that's where subscription pricing does make much more sense for content production, because in this case, you're actually getting the money up front. The money is funding the work, as opposed to the work being a speculative bid for the money. And one thing that I've forced over time and I'm very happy about is trying to get people to sort of annual subscriptions. So I think my audience at this point is like 70% annual subscriptions. At $150 a year, is that right? It's $12 a month, $120 a year. So you do get a $24 discount by being annual. You save on the $13. Yeah, it's a $16 difference, so that certainly makes a big difference. But then also, I just think it's good for me and it's good for my customers to know that, look, I have a chance to make it up to you. Your internet media business about the business of technology is a very different business than our internet media business about the business of technology across a number of dimensions. There's obviously the business model, your primary business model versus our primary business model, you're doing subscriptions, marketing, advertising, but there's also the periodic nature of content. I think one of the reasons we feel such pressure on each episode is when're only dropping one maybe two episodes a month. How many pieces of content are you doing a week at this point? Well less than I've once did read it or not. Usually three written pieces, one interview, two subject episodes, and two different episodes. So I guess that is eight pieces of content. When I first started the Daily is a lot more than SuperMunk, so there's a fair respect. All right, so because this is required in I'm playing format, please, David, I'm going to take us back to the game, and we're going to try not to dwell too long, because then I know you've told your story also, but I think it's important for context. So you get this inkling and idea that you can do this, and you have an idea for a way to cover the intersection of strategy and technology in a differentiated way than has been done before and you decide that you want to start doing it. I think you are still doing it while you're at Microsoft in 2014. Is that right, Ben? I've started tons of blogs through the years. I, in some respects, felt I missed out because I'm the same age as folks like Ezra Klein and Matthew Gracious and you know I was writer for a school newspaper and you know I started a blog and like man if I had sort of kept with it you know I could be doing what they do and then John Gruber started during Fireball around 2003 and so there was some aspect of like wow it's a bummer I missed out on that. To take the famous Mark Entry and sing yourself Silicon Valley and you feel like, oh, no, it's already all happened. Without question. So, you know, it's not a big question. You used to write a game, you used to do it. I think I did those Tumblr posts while I was at business school. And, yeah, I mean, it was definitely something that I always wanted to do just from a personal self-interest perspective. But also, it's not enough to just want to do something. There needs to be a market. There needs to be an opportunity. The way I always put it is there's lots of sites writing about these products, and Wall Street is writing about the financial results, but there's a big gap in the middle there. You know, like, what is the strategy that goes into the products? Like, what are the margins and the business models that undergird those products that drive to the financial results? How does company culture impact decision-making? Why do companies do stupid things? This is a common question in business school, and you would do these interviews, and you do prep when you're the first year, you're doing second year students, and you're helping the first year students. And my favorite question was always, what's a decision or a product this company has made that you think is a bad idea or you disagree with? And everyone would always have an answer to that. But the more interesting question is the follow-up question, which is why did they do that? And what you would see is a lot of people, their answer really was because they're stupid. And the reality is no one at these companies is stupid. A very popular place back then is Microsoft making the Zoom players. Like, that's a dumb blah, blah, blah. Why did Microsoft do that? It's not just useful for critique, but it's also useful for saying where companies should go. So I think probably Microsoft, even Microsoft and Facebook, are probably my two biggest successes as far as an analyst. I think particularly Microsoft, where I think I very clearly articulated what their issues were, and also by understanding those issues, the sort of organization that they were, the sort of capabilities they were, and not just the weaknesses that entailed, but also the strengths that entailed where they should go and the sort of strategy they should adopt. And that's basically the strategy they have adopted and obviously it's tremendously successful. But there's no one writing that sort of stuff back in 2013. One of the things we thought about a lot was we are not journalists. And we came at this from having worked in the industries that we're talking about and obviously we did too, having been in Microsoft, Apple, and plenty of other places, with that in mind, like anybody you mentioned, Klein, Gruber, we'll talk about Gruber later, but being journalists, they came out of the media, whereas we were all coming out of the industry. Yeah, it's interesting. I wouldn't classify either Klein or Gruber as journalists. I mean, they were bloggers. That's what they were. And they ended up as somewhat journalists, although I would say both of them, their best work has always been more analysis than journalism. I mean, maybe it's a stupid classification, but I think about journalists as sort of writing about what is happening at best, uncovering facts. Analysis is explaining why it happened, and opinion is some aspect of saying what you think should happen. You know, those have certainly gotten conflated over the years. That's probably a different discussion. But analysis and opinion, I think, do go together to some extent. But that's actually a line that I'm actually pretty careful about. I really try to not break news. That's actually an explicit choice on my side. I mean, it was an easy decision to make at the beginning because I knew no one. I had like 400 Twitter followers when I started. Everything that I wrote was self-generated, right? It was just my own insight, my own view of the situation. You didn't have any paper access. No access. Negative access, I sort of felt like. In part of the way, I couldn't write about Microsoft because I was some beyond there. I think that of my work experience with Microsoft, it was certainly the most impactful, not just because of what I learned about Microsoft, but just what you learn about big companies, I think, in general. And it's very easy on the outside to anthropomorphize these companies and like a single entity sort of making decisions and doing what you want and doing what you don't. And the reality is it hits thousands and thousands of people. There's massive coordination problems. Everyone has a different take, different opinion, which is why the culture stuff is so interesting, which is why the broad shared understanding of what a company is and is not capable of is so important to understanding why companies do what they do. Because actually it it tends to be much more impactful than single individuals, and definitely single individuals below the CEO level. And even then, what constrains a CEO's actions is a first-in-year thing. But they have to build a team to get apps for Windows 8. And so, I was responsible for social media, other than Facebook and Twitter. So, I guess, and Twitter. I was responsible for publishing. So the book publishers, Amazon, Kindle, things along those lines. I was responsible for lifestyle. So I really got to know the publishing industry very well, both on the magazine side, newspaper side, book publishing side. And all that was certainly useful learning for writing about those industries, but also very useful for understanding approdynamics, developer dynamics. It was super fun, very busy, very high, trying to get stuff out the door, working with, you know, half-filled SDKs and flying all over and working with developers. I never looked at once and it kind of sucked up until then. So I was at Microsoft and I remember my wife and I, it was our first other trip to Hawaii. I think this was the winter of 2012, 2013. And sat down and talked about it. I was like, yeah, it's probably going to be time to move on pretty soon. I mean, Microsoft was always a bit of an upset. I was always sort of an Apple person. That was my exception. I wanted to work at Apple. I had the good fortune of being able to intern there. I was at Apple University when Apple University had just started, and the original thing for Apple University was that it's going to be really focused on Apple has this notion of the top 200, although I think it's actually today more like the top 300 or something. They go to this big company retreat. They're the ones that know all the future plans that are just going on, and that's really sort of the decision makers at Apple. And it's not necessarily by management position. Like, there's ITs that are, you know, have no management responsibilities, but are, you know, sort of part of that core. That was an amazing experience, And really trying to figure out what makes Apple Apple, sort of defining the culture. And it did seem problematic that it's very hard to write culture down. Because then that's kind of a recipe, I think, for sort of auspication and getting sort of walked into something. What is interesting is it was written a lot about as a sort of Steve Jobs initiative. And I'm sure he okayed it, but he had basically no involvement at all. Tim Cook was very heavily involved. The Cook Doxian is based, right? It's inherently backwards looking because the data has to be generated first. And I think there's analogy to culture along those lines that, and the concern about writing it down and getting focused on that is you're sort of locking yourself in. And cultures are very, very powerful. It's the way that you coordinate a massive company and keep it going in going in the right direction, but culture is also very dangerous because if you have to change direction, suddenly you realize you're in a straitjacket. And I do wonder if writing stuff down and saying this is the way we do things is actually like sewing the straitjacket. I'm not sure how that pays off. Right. Culture and process accomplish the same goal in many cases. And so either it can be done in a process right away because the culture sort of facilitates what's getting done, but then you have no processes to change something if the culture is no longer facilitating what you want to do. Yeah, I think that's an interesting way to put it. Culture is probably the processes that can't be written down to some extent because it's just an understanding of this is how we do it. I left that summer feeling like this is not the right thing for me. You get to this school. You have to get a job. Everyone else is getting jobs. You feel like what you do immediately after business school, like has it such a great connection to business? And I was just like, yeah, whatever. It's like a job. Well, I was hell-bent on being in tech. And I have lots of opportunities and offers. Obviously, consulting was an option. It's interesting because I had a very nontraditional background being an English teacher in Taiwan. You know, I built a sort of distributed presentation system for a group of schools here. So there was like some sort of like tech angle per se. But really, I was just like an English teacher from Taiwan. We can be back to sort of the Ezra Con man-gray thing. You were kind of cut from that claw before getting into tech, right? You were college-high majors, right? Working college. Yep. And honestly, while that was my background, I grew up definitely blue-collar, but my parents were ministers. And you're in a small town of 2000, like the pastor is like the most educated person around, by and large. So there's that, well, the alternative to working in a factory or on the farm is you go to college to be like a professor or something. There just wasn't even any awareness of any sort of opportunities. And I think it's very not well understood by elites in general and people on the coast where it's not a lack of opportunity. It's a lack of even knowledge that there are opportunities elsewhere. And so for me, going to the University of Wisconsin was like this big-ass rebellion. They're like, oh, I'm not going to go to a Bible college or I'm not going to go to whatever. And in retrospect, I had the grades and test scores to go somewhere. I mean, Wisconsin's a great school, but I probably could have gone to an ugly school. I didn't even apply. That's what wasn't on your radar screen. Not even on my radar screen, not on the radar screen of anyone around me. And I think this is a perspective that is probably not very well understood by a lot of our audience, I think, to say the least. And so I actually love tech. I was very into it. I was the first person I knew around me to get an email address to sort of be online. Did you get the internet at home before you went to college or was college supposed to get internet? No, I pestered and pestered my parents to get internet. I think we started out with like a Juno account, which was just email only. Wait, was Juno the one that was a D.E. Shaw spin-out? Yes. That was an incubation of D.E. Shaw when things were there before anything. Yep. It was like a standalone client that was email only. And then emerged with zero. Yep. So, during college, you know, I was super online. Me and my group of friends stayed in the dorms an extra year just because of the broadband connection. Broadband is not very loosely here. I think it was like two megabytes up and down. I worked at the student newspaper, which I loved. One of the things that I did at the newspaper was I took over the editorial section my senior year. And so we sat down. We had five things that we wanted to see happen. We'll first decide, number one, editorials will only ever be about things that affect students. And what we did was, look, we're going to write an editorial every single day, Monday through Thursday. Friday, the whole page will be given away to death columns. We're going to write an editorial every single day, no matter what, and we're going to write about these five issues. And does that mean you writing an editorial every single day? Well, so we had an editorial board, but it basically ended up me writing an editorial every single day. That's what it came down to. Not every day, but the vast majority. And it's interesting because there is certainly, there's an echo of what I ended up doing with my career, right? Just sort of daily hitting points, having to generate content. But it was, number one, just from a classical perspective, it was fun and interesting, something I definitely enjoyed. And number two, it worked. Of our five sort of things, we had goals. We accomplished four of them. So I want to go forward to your leaving Microsoft. Give me the emotional moment where you're like, it feels like it could work. Like, I think there's something here. I think I have content markets there. Well, so, to go back to the Y trip, there was an aspect about going to Microsoft. Like, well, I should go to a place that is directly oppositional to everything I believe in, right? And can I make changes at Microsoft? You know, very sort of arrogant. Really, I learned a lot from Microsoft as opposed to the other way around. I sort of signed up for it knowing this is probably not what it's going to be long term. And after that trip is start Chatechery, I wanted to figure out a way to go back to Taiwan at some point. My wife from Taiwan and we enjoy living here. Also, again, I just felt like there was this hole and opportunity. And I sort of looked at Gruber as someone that was like, well, he did it. But it was also pretty clear that an advertising-based model was probably not going to work. I mean, that was obviously a way to see my mind about the centralization of advertising under Google and Facebook, and that world of starting a blog and throwing up some Google Ads was not going to be a viable one. But I think you think that, to my mind at least, there is a very viable and robust alternative issue where specifically is an advertising business model. So I think that I would have started much earlier, ... and then just happens to basically be an ad. It's the same format, same content as what's there. And I would bet that the rate of consumption to encountering it for his ads are higher than almost anything else out there. And obviously, Facebook does that at scale. And it's all automated. You self-serve and you scroll through and there's no piece of content you're shooting in and some of them are ads. But you didn't think you could do the same thing that John does? Well, I thought that was a possibility, a potential leg of the school. But number one, I didn't know that I could do the same format. I mean, what worked for him very well is because most of the stuff of court snippets and make out the phrases would check in and read everything, I ended up moving more towards longer pieces. I mean, I did experiment and play around with that format, and it didn seem right to me and then also just strategically you could see where things were going. This idea that users are going to Google, going to social media and that's the best and most obvious place to put advertising because that's where the users are, there's understanding about them, all those sorts of things. You know, advertising is an ROI measurement. It's not just what you're returned, but also how much work you have to do to get it. And why would someone want to go to a small blog and put the effort of putting an ad there? It didn't seem like a very scalable possibility. And meanwhile, at the same time, there had been this new company that was founded called Stripe. And it seemed viable to me that if you thought through the idea of, look, if I produce super highly differentiated content, that is something that is not going to appeal to the whole world, but to the people who like it, they'll really like it. And if you have that sort of audience, you should maximize your revenue per user. And the way to maximize your revenue per user is to charge them a subscription. And the tools were then becoming available to sort of do that. Just to validate the point real quick, and being a bit of a pushback on there being alternative history, worst protectory to the end given, for anybody who doesn't read During Fireball, and doesn't know who John Gruber is, that we're talking about, Chris Larson, when John says that he invented the in-feed advertisement, you go to DanFireball.net, GAPS.net, and you see the St. Exact website has been there for 10, close to 20 years at this point, and most of it is raced out to other things, some of its long-formed, well-thoughts through pieces, and some of it is sponsored posts. And I consumed, just like many other people, the entire feed in an RSS reader, and the sponsored posts would show up just like any other post in an RSS reader. Now, I think the set of people who are likely to use an RSS reader and who are likely to go directly to JerryFireball.net, the place where they're intentionally typing in the URL or clicking the bookmark bar and going through it, that set of Apple nodes is far more likely to do that page than anyone else in the world. The world is shifting away from going directly to pages and a lot of the readers are like, well, I'm just subscriptions, it can also work well for advertising. I think Google is at the right place at the right time for Apple for sure, not just in terms of Apple's growth, but also the exposure to the App Store. There was a period where he would have lots of apps as those sort of featured things. And so it works great for him. Again, I did have sponsored posts a little bit when I did go independent because I figured I'd have multiple revenue streams. I didn't remember that. How long did you do that for? Like six months. Again, the ROI wasn't there for me either. I couldn't charge that much and it was a big hassle and being in a range and then also there's a lot of complicated factors like pushing you with an email was not a good fit for that and so I started respectfully pretty clear that subscriptions would be the core model. I was going to try a lot of things to monetize. Clearly you know, but you probably knew that. I mean, there was no Substack. And I think in many ways, Substack was, I don't know the exact same, but probably modeled after you. Yeah, no, Substack's seed desk says, if I bring a box, that was their pitch. So this was a big innovation. Yeah, I mean, I think like the subscriptions did exist, I think on Wall Street in particular, but they were generally like $20,000, and you would get all the hedge funds to subscribe and the banks. And that model still exists, and it's actually a very, very profitable one. But what I do think Setechory innovated was sort of subscriptions at scale, where you're charging a low price relative to $25,000 or $10,000, and you're doing it on a self-serve basis. People sign up for a credit card. again, Stripe was a really important part of making this possible. But there were no real subscription tools. And I had to actually hack it all together when I first started. There was like WordPress subscription tools and there was Stripe and you had to glue them together. And it was sort of a big mess when I started. A year after I started, a company called Memberful then launched, which I switched to them. And that made and that made things definitely much easier and then obviously I have my own system now. You've worked with an outside development agency's custom-built software for which you are the only user to publish for Techery now, right? Yeah, at the beginning it was all me. I built my own page and I did all that integration myself and I'm not really a developer so it was very happy. Actually one of my nightmares was when I launched the paid product. The first century, I messed around format a little bit at the beginning. Actually, the real pioneer, who I should mention, was Andrew Colton. And he had this manic posting schedule, like tens of posts a day, and he did have a team to help him on the daily dish. And he switched to a subscription when I think he left the Atlantic. And it was just. Like, he quickly was doing a million dollars in revenue a year, but he sort of maintained that manic posting schedule that kind of made sense in an advertising-driven world where he wanted people always coming back and getting lots of impressions, and the paywall was super loose. It was like 30 posts and then you hit a paywall or something. And the reality is what happened was he burned out. I think he had some health issues and he ended up bleeding. And it was funny because when he left, everyone's like, volume's dead. It's finished with a failure. And I looked at him. I thought like, no, I think this was actually a huge success. One of the problems was he had this posting schedule and system and then he started to drop a paywall on top of it. And so when I thought about subsidiary, I wanted to do the opposite, where I wanted a subscription to not feel like from a customer perspective that I was taking stuff away, but that I was giving them more, just from a psychological perspective. And so once I realized I definitely wanted to do a subscription model, I started to become super disciplined about never writing more than twice a week. This was back in 2013, I was in trajectory. Because my plan was for subscribers, if they subscribe, they'd get more. And it would be like an exciting purchase as opposed to, oh, I'm hitting a paywall, this sucks. And your audience figure is going out before putting the paywall in, which says keep getting the same. That's right. And so my initial model was still getting Fireball right, where I figured, all right, I'd have big articles, and then if you subscribe, you're going to get a whole feed of them with the little stuff, my commentary on news articles. I built a new website, again, as a not very good web developer, and the metric I was paying attention to was people who visited the homepage on days I didn't post. Because to me, those were people that were hoping I had written, and they wanted more from me. And I figured, classic guy just X, Y, Z, and Y. But I thought that if I get 10% to this audience, that would be something that would be reasonable. And that metric was pretty high. I mean, I didn't appreciate then just how powerful social media was. And publishers bemoan social media, but those are publishers with old business models. If you have a new business model with a very low cost structure, social media is a godsend. You basically get free marketing. What a lot of people don't understand is I think a lot of writers give away way too much content on Twitter and they're out there posting. It's why should I read your site and you're just part of the other thing you think on Twitter and the reality is the power of social media is not that it gives you another platform I have a platform it's Shutter.com what it does do is give all my readers a platform to tell other people wow this site's really great look how smart I am for having a take on this thing that Ben wrote we can read about on his website right if you share something that's great, you get the likes and you get the retweets and you get the status of people saying, wow, this person is sharing good stuff. And that's really powerful. This is probably an angle. You mentioned the Mark and Jason quote, but I thought I was too late. In this case, it turned out that I was early. I was the only person doing this sort of model out there. And it was still an era of 2013 Twitter, 2014 Twitter, where people would share links to something and it would break through. It was simply good. This is also where the principle of having the second article be good is super important. This is, I think, unique to the social media era where people follow a link to a site and they would have paid no attention to what the site is. They don't even know where it is. You're a good artist. The boats, even in the first post, the sailboats, is quite good. Well, they did this for iPads and abilities. But the reason for that is, what I was really thinking about was, oh, wait, they'd follow an article. They'd follow another week. And they a month later, they'd follow another link. And like, wow, they'd go, hey, I haven't been on this site before. It's triggering my memory. And that's really, I think, the key moment. It's like, oh, yeah, I'm going to follow this guy on Twitter, or I'm going to put this site in my bookmark, or I'm going to put my RSS feed, or whatever it might be. And that's sort of the key thing that I think you want to accomplish. This is one of my big criticisms of Substack. Right? It's interesting because Substack I think is achieving some. There's your network effects where everyone's familiar with it, that your parents are on file. All that stuff is true, but nothing visually about Substack is memorable. Every single site looks the same. And also it'll be reading a post and also like bring down the other stuff. Who am I reading again? the current is also weird this is a weird typography unit but I'm like it always looks slightly wrong to me when I'm reading the body text yeah I agree specifically even the name I know in many respects it's a bad name for a word of mouth sight to be a name that no one knows how to pronounce but it's not an audio word of mouth sight it's a word of tooth it's super memorable for good or bad reasons. It's one of those no-exposures, bad-exposures sort of things. More importantly, the URL existed, the Twitter handle existed, it did exist in Google search, so there was plug-in devices. When did you come up with it? The name that I've always been the most jealous of is a Simco, again to go back to Horace Deju, it has all those qualities with the advantage of being pronunciable and easily spellable. So in retrospect, I always make fun of the trajectory name because it's easy to make fun of. But I do think there's a lot of positive qualities to it that are underappreciated from this memorability aspect. But there is an aspect where it is kind of hard to pronounce. People are afraid to say it because they're worried they'll say it wrong, and if they say it, they don't want to spell it, so it's not perfect by any means. It is based on the Strategery movie bit, right? They're supposed to be Strategery? Yeah, so it's from the attack, and yes, there was a Strategery bit, and so then I'm like, well, I should pronounce it that was a terrible idea. I think I did that for a month. Didn't it even say on the website it's pronounced strategery? Yeah, at the very beginning, yeah. And then I quickly realized that was a very bad idea, because it is strategy and text as a piece of secretary. Yeah, lots of poor decisions. It's very easy to look back and see all the good ones. But this is how you build brands. The only way is to do this stuff. I guess every single time we talk to someone who's built something in their own image from first principles with their ideas in a super opinionated way about how they wanted to sort of, like, boost their Internet child into the world, it has all these really rough edges for a while. Yeah, and that applied to lots of pieces. I mean, I had my people visiting the homepage of days I didn't post. So in the meantime, I was really looking for a job at Microsoft where I could still blog. Isn't that all about Microsoft? You just kind of show and you're playing a kind of blog. But I told you about Microsoft. And also, it was getting a lot of attention. Again, I was surprised at how quickly it blew up. I mean, this is where the other Gruber story comes in where I have appendicitis, so I'm laying in a hospital bed getting ready for surgery, and I'm like waiting around for a few hours. I had waited to email John because for the same person I was at the beginning, I wanted to have a body of content, not just like an introductory story. I said, oh, it's a hell of a new blog. How many emails does he get about that, right? And so I waited a couple months or a month or so, right? I said, hey, been a big fan. He had just been on a podcast telling his origin story and he also worked in the student's paper and XYZ. So I shared that, you know, I'm really related to this. I regret not doing what you did back in 2003. So I'm getting it to stop now. You're just, you are, you're not interested. And I heard nothing back. I did no other thoughts. And so, you know, I had my surgery. It was very successful. No problems. A couple weeks later, I'm at Microsoft, and I get an email from him pointing out that I made a grammatical error. I think it was the word. I used the wrong one. And he was like, I make this mistake all the time. He's telling me the etymology of each one, and that's all the email says. No closing like, I love your work. No, full stop. It was just explaining that I used the wrong word and what different words meant, what I probably meant to use. So I thought, well, he's probably going to post the link to the site. I was very excited. So I'm sitting on the analytics page, and I'm sitting on Danny Fireball, who will post. And I was hoping for just a short link, right? He has all those short snippets. Instead, it's a full article and he starts out saying, all my readers should be reading this new site that I've discovered, I've discovered, of course, Paul's Detectory is the best new site I've encountered in years and with like three articles that I've discovered with the help of the topic. He's like, this article, this article, this article. It's like 500 words of just the most glowing craze imaginable. And then he gets to the end. He's like, but for the first time, I disagree with Thompson. And then he spends another thousand words saying I was wrong about something. Which is fine. I mean, I think he was wrong. And there was a side of a beautiful friendship. Do you remember the miracle that happened to your traffic after that? So the thing I always would index on was Twitter followers, because that was a very clear metric of people who had affirmatively decided that they wanted to know what I had to say. And I don't think it's the case anymore, but for a long time, my percentage of subscribers actually followed was a 6% of my Twitter followers. Huh. Paid subscribers were a 6% like people who subscribe to a daily life, I think. Yeah. Which meant I knew my limiting factor on subscribers was awareness of who I was. So I had 500 Twitter followers when he posted that. And within 12 hours, I had 1,500 Twitter followers. And that sounds very small. I mean, I have 200,000-some followers now. Tripling hour over hour, I think they were great to come down to that. That's right. And also, it was a lot of people that were also bloggers or writers or influential. There were two step changes in such as growth. That was really the first one, for sure. The next day, I'd get reached out by the head of strategy at Microsoft or a week later. He'd be like, hey, can we have a meeting? I'm like, okay, I don't know. He just summoned through the principles off. At least he's not the head of PR. That would have been way worse. So I would agree with him. He wanted to hire me. He was like, I'll pump you up to a number 55. You know, I can't remember what that was kind of like. Who was the head of the strategy at the time? No, his name is Charlie Saundhurst. Oh yeah. So, and I kind of skipped him out. I knew he was probably leaving soon. He did a leaving shortly after. He's like, no, go live in Taiwan. Just fly back once a month. It'll be fine. But fortunately, I turned him down. But all this is a circuitous way to say I did feel I needed to leave Microsoft. But this thing was taking off. It wasn't sustainable. Number one, I quit writing about Microsoft. And it was job that would let me continue to do this. So Automatic worked out. It actually worked out even better because I was hired as a growth engineer or whatever, which I didn't really know anything about. But then the team I was on pivoted shortly after I was there to building a new back-end of WordPress. And so there was nothing for to do we didn't have a product out but fortunately there was a little bit of put back internally because I was becoming this very visible blonder it's like what the hell like this guy's working for us I thought we were supposed to have because back then automatic was one of the few distributed companies because it wasn't where you wanted to so as soon as I got the job we moved back to Taiwan and you weren't supposed to have a second job for sort of obvious reasons. And I think Matt did run some interference for me where he's like, no, don't worry, he's good. And the one thing I did do for Automatic is I went through a lot of the company, what they were doing, and I wrote this big strategy document about where they're at, what they should do. It had some impact, I think, on where they end up going. You guys should buy Tumblr. It was at the time when they were, it had been a very small company, and around that time they decided to raise a lot of money and grow into being sort of a much bigger one. Again, I don't know how much impact I had. Matt says I had a big impact. He may be being generous. I don't know. But I kind of actually ended up working mainly directly with Matt. And he mostly left me alone, and then he would have a question or whatever and I would think about it and write something off and come back. Well, nominally being the growth engineer for this team that did not have a product in the market. So, I owe Automatic a lot but it was also very stressful. I felt really guilty. I was like, I'm really devoting all my energy to tie this trajectory and I'm getting paid by Automatic. Just that was internally very stressful to me and that wasn't the idea like, and that's not cliche, but I raised in a Midwest blue collar town. Like, I'm getting paid far more than I've ever made in any time in my life, and I don't feel like I'm devoting all my time and energy to this company. That was very internally stressful. And so I got this job to be like a consultant for this company that wanted to expand to A-specific. And I'm like, well, I can do this consulting job and then I can make this actually a paid thing. I couldn't do that while I got automatic again. You just want to have a separate paid job while being there. And so you left automatic to go do this sort of potential consulting thing? Well, no. First, I left automatic because I'm like, I need to build this subscription bit and this new website before I start the consulting shop. So I left automatic. I'm working on building this. What happened was that it just didn't materialize. Oh, no way. You burned the boats and then there was no car. So I lost this equity. And the idea was you would log in. You'd get this much more experience. And I lost it. Number one, I had something wrong with security to test it. So the first 24 hours, no one could make a purchase. And so I'm like up $36 straight. I barely stopped the week before, so I'm like finalizing the site. I stupidly had like reached out to like Paris Whistler at Recode, and so she had a pre-scheduled post of their announce I was going to pay, and so I got this stupid artificial deadline that made zero difference other than stoking my ego. And so it was awful. It was a horrible experience. But the worst thing was that the product sucked. It was super confusing. I didn't achieve my goal of having a good experience for non-paying customers that I really lured them in. And for paying customers, it didn't work well. It was very janky. And it sucked. It was really, really bad. So over the weekend, I'm just miserable. And I know I screwed up. And I burned my bridges and all this sort of thing. And I realized that, look, man, that's tough. The business model's right. The plot is wrong. So over the weekend, I tore the whole thing out. I went back to the old website. And I told the people that subscribed, I'm like, look, I appreciate you subscribing. The format's all wrong. What I'm going to do is, for your subscription, I'm just going to email you. I'll email you once a day with the extra stuff that I promised you. And so I felt completely and utterly asked backwards in the email. I thought it would all be on the website. I've been thinking this whole time, I'm like, I've not tried to email once. Yeah, and my mentality is always just checking the website first and foremost. It's like, look, I'll deliver you this extra stuff to your email. And it will also be on the website on the sidebar. And it will be archived there. But you're going to get an email. And it worked out in the long run. In the short run, though, I had a one-day goal for new subscribers. Well, I guess a two-day goal because the site was not so full for the first day. I had a one-day goal, a one-week goal, and a one-month goal, and I failed to recall them. And failed pretty significantly, honestly, to recall them. And so on there, I'd given up this six-figure job living in Taiwan, business school debt, and an idea that I thought could work but did not seem to be working very well. And it was very, very stressful. I mean, I stopped paying all my credit cards because especially back then, Taiwan was very cat-centric, so I needed to preserve cats. I was, you know, not sleeping. I also watched a podcast at the time, which was Exponent with James Allworth. So I'm writing, as I mentioned before, seven times a week, plus doing a podcast. I'm doing all the editing for the podcast, all the production, all this sort of stuff. And I thought I'm going to have to, like English again to pay the bills at the same time. And then I think the first month when I tore all that out, I screwed up the subscription, so I double-charged a whole bunch of people to have possible these refunds, to have customer support. And it was pretty tough. I launched in April. This is April 2014? 15? 2014. So next year will be 10 years to secretary, like nine years of it being my job. So back forward to the summer, we're back in the States. My wife and I have planned a long, standing trip. We're going to go to Paris and leave the kids with my parents. You felt so good there a little bit, but you must have had some thoughts in those intervening months where you're like, well, she's always got to do that on all this, right? Yeah, but like there was certainly a pride back there. I couldn't spell on it. Like, I mean, no one thought I would succeed. I had lots of people reach out, they're like, hey, Ben, I love you, but the sisters are not a thing I've been heard of. It's not going to work. And a lot of people in tests, especially BCs, which is weird because they always know exactly what's right. No, they're very conventional wisdom driven, I think. So, I can still picture that. I was sitting at the kitchen table at my parents' house in Wisconsin. And you look at the numbers and my May subscribers are more than April. June is more than May. Why was I'm pace to be more than June? And we're still talking like a couple hundred, not very many. Oh, and I'd also have like multiple levels. So some of the people I like to stream down level where I was supposed to like chat with them and have several calls and all this sort of stuff. Yeah, everybody starts that way and then quickly gets rid of it. And I'm also going to do like sponsored posts. It really is an overwhelming amount of stuff. But I look at those numbers, I'm like, I think it's going to work. And so I paid off all the card cards that have been running out for the last few months. My wife's like, should we cancel the trip? I'm like, no, we're not going to finish this. You know, she was very mad at me. She was like, you threw away this six-minute job. And so I didn't want to tell her how poorly things were going. You didn't give an idea to be analytics? No, of course not. And I'm like, no, we're not canceling our trip. Things are going great. And so we flew to Paris, where I thought I'd go back up again, of course. And in Paris, I remember, I would wake up every morning at 4am, sit in the bathroom and write a day of update and then my wife would wake up and go out for the day. And that doesn't seem true. It just sort of kept increasing. I mentioned there's two big step changes, the driver one being the first one. In November, I actually ended up reaching $1,000, which was my one-year goal. So I hit my one be a little bit of that. But without a new subscriber, they will tell new people. But networks get exhausted. And so it's more than linear. But if you zoom out, it's really linear visiting the homepage and they didn't subscribe. What I was wrong about is that the vast majority of people thought I would stay on the other business. They didn't want to lose their money. And so they didn't subscribe. But once it was clear I would be an ongoing entity, then like, oh, okay, I guess my money will be safe. And so I will now subscribe. I was right about the market. I just understand that psychological aspect. One thing that I think is great for is that I went back to Substack, making it easier to pay. I think the real great thing for Substack and Substack Writers today, it's not that it's easy to pay, but people aren't scared to give their money to some random writer on the internet. And they were previously, and now they're not. I think that's really great and something I'm very proud of. Wait, so what was it about yours where they suddenly became afraid? Because I had a thousand subscribers. I was making $100,000 a year. It was it that they thought that before they knew that you were secure, that you might just stop writing, and then they would have paid you, and then they would have paid you and then they would get nothing for it. I think that was really the case. And so then since then, it never had a growth explosion like that since then, 25% growth in one day. But it's been sort of slow and steady since that point. That accidental email hack, how do you think about it? Now, you still think about protecting primarily the website. But how do you think about email now? Obviously, it's a big part of what you do. Yeah, it is, but it's not. I mean, I think if you see the stuff that I've done, for example, now you can consume the daily update via a podcast or my articles via podcast. I think that's actually very much in line with my vision and view of protecting, which is this is a publication publication that I write and I will make it as easy for you to consume in the way you want to consume as possible. And back in 2014, that meant sending emails. And certainly there's all the advantage of emails that everyone's talked about because see that everyone texts daily. You don't need permission to get in there. There's no algorithm. You know, it's funny because I think once stuff that came along, it became overwhelming and people started setting up rules to send other emails to a holder which they never checked. Your packets are the same problem. A self-imposed algorithm, which is where a podcast is great. It's the same idea. It's a feed that people check that, I mean, rush through polling, but to people it feels like push. And that's certainly a great thing from an independent publisher perspective. And I think in line with my vision. I mean, one of my criticisms of Substack was I think they were too email-centric to start. Again, I think the web experience is important. It's super important for growth because that's where people find out about stuff is often via social media and sharing links. And email is a tactic. It's not a strategy. And at the end of the day the strategy is about differentiation it's about consistency and i want it to be easy to use and fit in your life and email was a way to do that again sort of back into now podcast way to do that you can get such articles on the sms which gives you a link and you can read on the website obviously i've always had rss and I just want to make it as easy for you to access the content that you're paying for as possible because that sort of makes the whole thing go. And, you know, you've mentioned Fern. The beautiful thing about this model is, number one, from a writer perspective, all I really need to worry about is keeping my subscribers happy. And so, like, you know, should this be a free article? Should it be paid? Well, you know what? If it should have been free, but it made it paid, that's fine. My subscribers feel like they got a great article that they paid for and they feel good about that. And that recurring revenue is really, really powerful. And then also, that's my marketing channel. I'm telling other people about that this is good and you should sort of check it out. And one thing to do with Passport is a big way've built to enable other people to build for tech-repanic experience if they're whitelisted by you. How does that work? No, it's just my stuff for now. I mean, obviously we'll love to make it probably available. It's not all finished yet, and there's a couple of support issues and things that would entail that, but something that I would like to do. But one of the things we did with that is I went to myself a lot, which people make fun of and deservely so because it's kind of a running joke between me and my readers. But a way I think about tech free is it's a live thing. It's an ongoing sort of journal of my attempt to understand the world, to understand technology. And sometimes I was right about something and I was always fun to point back if I was right. Sometimes I was wrong. It's like, why was I wrong? What mistakes did I make? Sometimes there's a trend, and it's like, well, this happened back then, and this happened here. And then, again, I think about it as being sort of a live thing, and so waking back to myself is a way to do that. It's also a great way to trigger that second article sensation, you read an article and then there's a link right there and you go read another article. Wow, that was also really good. And then there's XYZ. So one of the things that I wanted to do with Passport was how can I really leverage email forwarding to accomplish this, especially when I'm looking to paid articles. So one of the things we do there is every link to myself in a statutory email is tokenized and that token goes one way to. So even if that email is forwarded to you, you can go read old stuff, so you get that second article sensation. Now, if you're in that second article, when you click another link, now you're going to pay well, and then you're going to realize, oh, I have to pay to get this. But there's all these little bits and pieces that the subscription model makes possible, which is really leaning into just serving your customers, trying to make it as good of an experience for them as it can be. And the other really important thing about subscriptions is there's always debate about, oh, people just write for clicks and blah, blah, blah. And then the publishers or the editors will come back and say, no, we don't even show our writers their click numbers. Like, they don't know. All we want them to do is write content. And I think that's so foolish because everyone wants feedback. They want affirmation. They want to know, did I do a good job? And if you don't even get access to your quick numbers, where do you go? You go to Twitter. What are people saying about me? Right. You will find a way to figure out if you've graduated or not. Right. And who's on Twitter? The biggest loudmouth, right? And one of the things that I learned on Twitter about Twitter very early on was I would be very engaged on Twitter. I'd be responding to people. And if something had occurred to me, I'm responding to the same 10 people or external people or whatever it is, right? So true. Yeah. You're going to be with .2% of your audience. Right. And so that's a fixed number. And meanwhile, I have a feedback mechanism, which is my subscriber number, which is going up, which means I know there's a huge number of people that like and appreciate and are sharing, and it's all dark matter. I don't know who they are. I don't know where they are, but they like what I'm doing, and I need to anchor on that, not worry about what the wild-dolls of Twitter are saying. And so subscriptions give this feedback mechanism. And it's a feedback mechanism for people that will never email you, that will never contact you, but they will pull out their credit card and they'll give you money. And I think that's so valuable and so positive from an incentive structure. Now, there is a downside where subscriptions are niche, right? And I do think you tend, people will, if they dislike you, they should stop paying. And there is a worry and a challenge that you're not like pandering to your audience or whatever it might be. I think I'm kind of lucky because I was so early, because I was the only person in this space doing this sort of stuff. I got to a large enough audience size where I could not care. And if someone wants to cancel their subscription, I don't care. In fact, if someone comes back and if they are just over-the-top rude or disrespectful or insiduating things about me, I will not just cancel the subscription. I will refund them their entire purchase and say, please, just never come back. Isn't that the nice thing about an appreciable price point? Actually, your dollars are insignificant to me because my number of subscribers is so much larger. It's very different than if Apple decides to stop advertising on Twitter. It's like, oh, crap. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm coming back. Yep, that's exactly right. And again, would I have been able to do that when I had a very small number of subscribers? No, but I mean, it was easier back then because, I mean, I started in 2013 and the entire opinion of the tech press on Wall Street, blah. So I'd be, no, I don't think Apple's doomed, to be honest. You know, that's why I wrote that, like, transition was wrong, because all the disruption people were like, you know, Apple for sure screwed, unless they go down market. I'm like, no, I don't think they need to go down market. And so that was great, because if not, I was writing anything that controversial, and so I didn't even run into any issues where people would try to hold over me. And by the time I got into issues where that mattered, I was large enough that it didn't matter. So I think I was definitely fortunate in that regard.

Thanks to the pilot co-founders, Laseem, Dushka, and Jeff for providing this awesome 20% discount for the first six months of service if you go to pilot.com slash acquired. Thanks, pilot. It's better. Can you share, like, what does the shape of the curve look like in terms of, if you graph it on the x-axis is time and the y-axis is number of subscribers from the start of the tech rate today. You talked about going up to a thousand and then adding to fifty and half-step change. And even if it's relatively linear, has it sort of taken off over time like are you saturating the world of tech people who care about business strategy? Yeah it's interesting because there's been different periods where it actually has started to taper and that actually accelerated this is probably 2018-2019 around there over the last couple years it has tapered off it's not quite what it was which is fine in terms of the growth of taper paper dogs. I mean, it's a certain revenue. If it's getting flat, you're increasing. Yeah, well, and then also I raised prices a couple years ago, which is the only time I've raised prices, and I still kind of mildly regret it. It's funny because everyone's like always, your prices are low, you should raise prices. That's definitely the absolute easiest way to increase revenue. I think the easiest thing for me to do would be to just keep doing what I'm doing and just raise the price a dollar a year every year. And for sure, my revenue increase would very much outweigh my churn. I'd rather say the biggest change that happened when I did raise prices was it didn't affect growth at all, except that I had a lot more people switch to annual subscriptions. I like pre-announced and said, hey, if you want to get a year at the old price, which is great because I love people on annual subscriptions as we sort of discussed at the beginning. So I could do that. I think my view on it has always been, I think in general, the markets are much larger than people think. I thought it was much larger than all the folks that are critical of my model thought and it's been larger than I thought all along, right? I thought it would take five years to build or to launch as my business. It took a year. And I would rather explore the edges of that market, how big it is, as opposed to sort of maximizing my revenue too soon. And so that's sort of number one. Number two is I do want to have an impact. I do want people to read. By definition, the larger your subscriber base, the more your sort of marginal customer is not aware of you, is not immersed in the space, their willingness to pay is going to be lower. And so when you start raising prices, you're going to get a wall very fast, I think, as far as subscriber growth, sort of by definition. That's goal number two. The sort of shift over the last couple of years has been, well, is this it? I've reached my natural base or whatever it might be, which is, again, massively larger than I ever expected. I just wanted to pay the bills. Yeah, like tens of thousands of people that pay you to read your work and millions of people that, I'm sure, come to your website and read the food products. Like, there is a real market for this. I would definitely put that kind of millions. I think it's interesting because I do think, and this is an area where I do feel I got there in time, I think the ability to spread on social media on Twitter has really diminished. You know, Twitter famously really started devaluing tweets with links a few years ago, which I think has made the product much worse. I mean, that's how we end up with all these threads, because those spread more. Oh, threads. Oh, my God. Yeah, it all should be blog posts. So I think that has hurt it. The other thing that has hurt my growth, frankly, is we're going to see stuff as a podcast. So my subscribers love it. Half my subscribers now listen instead of read, which is amazing. That's why I can see everything blog posts. Yeah, and then the other good thing is people would churn because emails would build up. And they'd look at their inbox, there'd be like 200 emails, and they're like, why am I paying for this? Whereas an eight-minute podcast, just so I can knock this off real quick. So it's been very good for churn, but the problem is people don't share a podcast, right? You wish to do a podcast, you go to the next podcast, you do XYZ. Whereas if you're reading something, it's super easy to tweet it or to forward the email. Quick forward here. Yeah. So I do think that might be the biggest issue on why my growth slowed down, to be honest, which is fine. It is what it is. And you're obviously leaning more into podcasts, right? I do think this is this year, which is growth is somewhat leveled off. Do I raise prices and sort of be happy with the base that I have? And I think it would be worth a shot to see if I can restart growth in this case by sort of working to increase and broaden the value of a directory subscription. And not just my own content. Well, I launched Dithering with Gruber. Obviously, he's now my podcast partner a couple years ago. That was like an add-on. So you pay extra and you get dithering. And that was really on the, let me let me make more money for my best subscribers as a way to raise prices on my best subscribers without explicitly raising prices right was wanting given a business decision or just a this is going to be a fun thing with a good friend or both of both and then also i had this technology for pay podcast that was a way to do it and so yeah we watched it it's been successful i mean like, from day one, we have, like, 10,000 subscribers. And then it's sort of level seven. It's kind of like, where are we stuck? We didn't turn it off. But on how do you go up a podcast? We haven't done anything around three episodes of marketing. We will. But that was a de facto price raise on my best customers. And when I wanted to sort of explore this space, it's like, well, is my market as big as it can be? And is there a way to sort of go broader? Figure it out, the newsletter thing. I think subscriptions make tons of sense for podcasts. Because people get so attached to a podcast, they get so attached to a particular host, and it becomes such a part of their routine to a much better extent than reading, which is sort of more of an affirmative choice. You have to go read this. Whereas, like, oh, this is my podcast player. I guess I'll listen to this next. And so I think it's a great product for subscription, but it's totally unclear how do you actually build a podcast, particularly a paid podcast. It's really hard to get people to start to listen to it. And so, in general, I think writers tend to succeed with podcasts because writing is a good marketing medium. Again, it spreads easily, you just pass the URL so people become familiar. Oh yeah, I'll tell you a podcast because I like you as a writer. But if you're just a pure podcast, how do you sort of grow? And so what I decided to do is Gittering's no longer going to be an add-on. It's going to be a part of a study description. So now, again, your study description is worth more because you have this sort of extra piece and you got it for quote unquote free. So you don't sell it separately at all. Or it is available separately. It's going with John and some of your subscribers maybe don't like me if they like to subscribe again. But it no longer has an add on to separate. If you are a subscriber, you get different. It's part of your subscription. Lots of new podcasts called Subtech that, again, there's both free episodes and paid episodes. It's available to all such subscribers. So your subscription is worth more. And so people are sort of popping in, just to make the point, because I've listened to every single episode of Gittering, including the back how long before you launch. I've started retailers, made the heart tech, and of course, I'm trying to let you know what I'm talking about. It seems to me that sharp tech and Gittering is sort of like, well, I get Ben, and I get Ben's thoughts, and I get a lot of the same thoughts, and I basically am picking whether I like Andrew or John better, and I'm also picking the format and duration of the episode. Yeah. Right now, the bundle is kind of a joke, because it's mostly just me, right? And different places have been. I only have so many opinions. I have a lot of opinions, but I only have so many. So it's not in its long-term place now for sure. And it's very tricky because there is an extent to your point about if you release a bad episode of Acquired, you worry about turn. Am I diluting what susceptibility is to someone? It's no longer just an email. And now I'm reintroducing the possibility that people feel overwhelmed with content. And then they also feel like, oh, Ben's repeating himself all the time. I think there's a lot of underrated risks in doing what I'm doing. But number one, I think watching Star Sino was a good signal to my audience of what I do want to sort of accomplish going forward. Where that's a collaboration with Bill Bishop who writes Sinochism, and it's the first or second product that I'm not on. But I think it's an important topic, understanding China. I think it's of a similar tone and quality level of what you should expect from susceptibility. Do I expect all susceptibility subscribers to listen to? No, of course not. Some people like me specifically, and I'm not on there, so they're not going to be interested. But I think for a lot of folks, it's like, well, I keep hearing lots of news from China. Where do I go? I'm already a successful subscriber. There's this other product here. And if they become a regular self-China listener, I'd now decrease my turn that much more for that sort of person. And I think, again, a big part of the decision is just turn management. It's like, I want to make sure this is a long-time subscriber and you get that recurring revenue over time. As you might imagine, the plans for other podcasts either sort of be added in the long run. And we'll see what happens. I mean, growth has, I think, picked up over the last couple months. Those early indicators are that it's working, where I'm increasing the value and will make up for the cost. Would I make as much if I just raise the prices and bring on the additional cost of paying for Andrew and other podcasters and those lines. Probably not. Again, the revenue maximizes it seems for me if you're going to stay with Numberful and just like Steffery. And it's nice and simple. Yeah. But number one, I've always been worried about getting stale. I know I have critics I hear about on Twitter who think I already am. But they're 0.2% of your audience. Well, who knows? There's only a lot on Twitter, right? Number two, one thing I'm so proud about with Secretary, I've got multiple known social secretary, but I'm so proud of the business model and that it exists. And the fact that Substack is out there and there's hundreds of thousands or how many people making their living doing this. And I feel responsibility for that in a very positive way. And I really want to get this working for podcasts. I think there's a similar opportunity. And so helping to help pioneer that is fun. Building software is fun, even though it costs me a lot of money, as you might have mentioned. Producing your podcast is fun. Seeing how this bundle thing is fun. How do you cross-link stuff? Like, you know, if you listen to this episode, because we know who you are, because it's a unique thing to you, you can just add another podcast without having to sign in or do anything. Like really smoothing out this experience of cross-promotion. It's fun. And I think I'm fortunate enough that the tech race has been successful enough that I can make choices that, at least in the short term, are more optimal for figuring stuff out and having fun, even if it's not revenue optimal. And obviously, there's upside. Maybe it'll end up being a huge thing and I'll make much more money than I ever would have just been a secretary. But I do feel very fortunate that I can make that choice in the social medium term. Nice thing about having no outside shareholders. You're your little bunch of brother there. We want to buy Fiat on whatever sounds most fun to you. You're the right. No, for sure. I actually thought about building a sub-staff a few years before they launched. I actually thought about building a sub stack a few years before they launched. I actually had a team together and it ended up falling apart. But my big hesitation was always, I just wasn't sure if it would be venture scale. And from my perspective, if you have the stamina and capability to produce regularly, subscriptions are an amazing ability to sort of bootstrap. And again, you're actually able to pay for the regular production content. It's actually a very straightforward transaction and can be sort of very sustainable. How many of those are venture-scale businesses? I think maybe not as many. And you're right. It comes with a bunch of compromises. It comes with a bunch of trade-offs. You have to optimize in certain ways. And I think venture is a phenomenal thing. I think I'm not anti-venture at all. Just anti-venture for me. I don't think it would make much sense. I like the lifestyle. It's a lifestyle business for me. You were talking to two wealthy capitalists who have a business which is best of the same as yours. So I love that you had this conversation because I was very curious and selfishly first. I'm curious your thoughts on there are corporations that have large numbers of people that make products that are scalable. And there's gaps in them in the spectrum that's being talent. You're a solo business, but your business is being talent in other people's productions. But the internet has enabled this whole new class of stuff, like your tech, your local client, like not boring, like what have you. How big do you think this third class of whatever it is we are can be? Is that part of what this experiment is? For sure. Like I'm not passionate about like meta's business prospect. I definitely have takes on it. You know, I think that's the other company I've mostly been pretty right about over the years along with Microsoft or probably my two long-standing best calls but calls, but I'm not like waking up in the morning, telling myself, like, if their stock goes up or down, I don't really care. You're not going to work at that. I'm not going to work at that. I think that's a pretty safe... I mean, if I don't have to buy them for $100 million, I guess I'll turn out. You'll rest and vest. Yeah, I will rest and vest, yeah. I mean, Mark, you're listening. But what does get me super excited, I'm really passionate about, is this completely new arena of possibilities, and I think new jobs that are made possible by the internet. And actually, one of the reasons I actually am, in general, favorable what I am personally very passionate about, which are the economic opportunities made possible by the Internet. What the Internet does do in industry after industry, and this applies to creative talent as much as anything else, is number one is always about the effect. You're either very large or very small. You're very large, you get scale, you get aggregation effects, and then you can make massive investments or acquisitions, or you can immediately see that to hundreds of millions or billions of people and get a payoff. Or, you take advantage of the internet and open for software or whatever it might be or different platforms, and your cost structures are basically zero, and you only need a thousand true fans. A000 true fans was 100% true. That was my guiding vision and ended up being the case. And so if you're stuck in the middle, which all the old publications were stuck in the middle, they weren't big enough to get allegation effects. Their cost structures were way too large to handle a fractured audience. They were all in trouble and got a lot of trash about saying they were doomed and then they were doomed. But's why they hate social media. But if you're on the low end of the dollar, they're like, you love social media. No, that's right. It's an amazing asset. So that's number one. The internet has its effects. Number two, the internet has winner-take-all effects in specific markets. So it's going to be hard for someone to be a generalist tech and media analyst and do what I do. It's possible. I didn't think that was very good, but just because I got there first. But that doesn't mean there's only one analyst role available. There's a guy, Neil Seibert, I think, which we can actually fix the company in a bank. Yeah, he's right with Apple. And he very much managed his business after me. He was pretty early, too, so he actually did a lot of stuff himself. He's done a really great job. He's been an independent Apple analyst for eight years or something like that, which is fine. He writes about Apple every single day. Believe me, there are people that want to hear about Apple every single day. And so that's an example where it seems like we're doing the same thing, but we're in different markets. This is what the internet makes possible. The key to success on the internet is you want to be the biggest fish in the pond, but the success metric is not competing with other fish, it's finding your own pond. The opportunity is broad, it's not a piece. In each pond, there's probably only one or two fishes that survive, right? But there's an infinite number of potential ponds. You can define your pond in in very specific parameters. I'm still surprised there's not someone that writes on Amazon every day. Like, it's a massive, sprawling business. There's so many things to write about. I think you'd probably make a 10-year-old Google. Casey Newton basically likes on social media every single day. It's been Christmas for him over there because it's been Twitter stuff. But that's fine. I feel guilty when I write about Twitter too often. It's very exhausting. I cover lots of other stuff. There's other things to talk about. And so I'm writing about it more than I want to. I really don't want to write about Twitter. Obviously, Twitter take on Apple is going to be, everyone's been anticipating it. It's the Super Bowl of Ben Thompson's thing. I kind of have to write about it, right? Right. But Casey writes back to the expectation is that he write about Hosea Bia. So he's written about Twitter every single day for like a month. And that's exactly what people want. And I'm glad he exists from my perspective. Hey, if you watch Twitter coverage every single day, go read cases. That's a great thing from my perspective. And I think that sort of defines this market. And so, number one, I'm really proud that this business model for newsletters exists. I think it should exist for podcasts. And I think part of that is just figuring out the mechanics of it. Like, how do you market? How do you grow stuff? I haven't done a good job marketing my paid podcast, I would say, other than leveraging techery. But that's something number one we want to work on. Obviously, there needs to be some video stuff. Like, there should be, you know, what's the ratio of free stuff to clips, to snippets, things on those lines. We're actually experimenting that more with self-private and self-tech, where you're on the free feed, you're getting more clips and snippets. Also, I think that the technological aspect is important. It's funny, even free podcasts, it's like, oh, we're going to have a guest on. Go listen to this podcast. Go to your podcast player, search for XYZ, and it's like offloading this huge number of steps to the user hoping they follow through and do it whereas we've built something where go to your show notes, click the link, boom, it's your podcast player, right? I think that's something that's going to be important to sort of, you know, the sharing stuff is really tricky because people don't share a podcast naturally so I want to figure that stuff out and it's gratifying, again, not just because it's fun and new and than my day job, but also that is my passion. My passion is these sort of businesses, the internet, not just destroying old business models, but making new ones possible. And not just the big guys, but like for individuals as well. And I'm very grateful and so very fortunate that I sort of get to do both. Yeah. I want to switch gears and ask you about aggregation series. We'll keep on this question here. So the business that you're running is far, far, far superior to a thing that I'm sure you've been asked a million times about when you write a book. You make $150 a year per subscription, at least that's what I pay for the full bundle, I think. No, you have a refund than a discount, $120. All right. Then I say $120 a year. Yeah, your ring is now wrapped into a specific subscription, so yes. I should be clear for anyone listening, you got a credit on your subscription. We did not issue refunds, but you did get a credit. But that is to say, I have no idea what I'm paying, and there's some segment of your listeners that are so wildly price-intensive about what you do that it doesn't matter. So it's probably hard to price you spend it on them. Yeah, those are looks at equal prices strategies. Yeah, those are not optimal. But anyway, my quick math was if you get $150 a year, and I know it's only $20, and you assume something's five-year lifetime on customers, and you compare that to what you would make selling somebody a book once, which is what, $20 times 7% goes to the author, it's literally 500 times more revenue to you to do what you do versus writing a book. And on the other hand, there's something that you've become known for in aggregation theory and some other topics around the edges of it that sort of deserves a canonical work. It's sort of a modern Porter's Five Forces. It deserves a canonical notion rather than something that's been edited and revised and attached and rethought through. So have you thought about what form canonical Ben Thompson topics would take? Yeah, I think there is the obvious one. I think the time to have written that book would probably be 2017. I mean, I was writing about the ideas of Alienation Theory from the very beginning. It's hard to imagine, but back in 2013, again, like, back then, people thought Apple was doomed. People thought the internet was inherently decentralizing. Oh, it was not running after the Facebook IPO, and it was in the downspit. Yeah, and Facebook was doomed. What I then backstaffed the other thing, I was able to come out of the gate with really four takes that were, right, because I had that. Number one, Apple's not doomed. They're actually going to be doing very, very well. Number two, the internet is centralizing. It's not decentralizing. Everyone's understanding dynamics are completely wrong. Again, today, everyone understands that, but it was, believe it or not, very controversial a decade ago. Number three, this is what Microsoft would do. Like, there actually is a clear path forward. They're not doomed to irrelevance. And then number four, Facebook is way more dominant and valuable than anyone thinks. And so, again, I said, I've watched a flow-hanging fruit to sort of fit. Well, it can be such deprecating, obviously, but I think part of the reason this is Brian James Claston, you know, it deserves kind of a co-work, the reason he's accepted truths in reality realities now is in large part due to your work. It is a bit humbling to be a writer because I think people would understand all those things had I not written it. I think at best they understand that maybe a few months or at best a year or two before it becomes common knowledge. And that's just the reality of the game. The edge you can provide is usually measured in sort of months or years or a very low number of years. I do think Arrogation Theory should be a book. It was probably, again, more pertinent at the height of all these sorts of things. Maybe it's so pertinent now, but number one, now there's just a way to go with this issue. I write every day, and to your point, I make way more money every day than I would writing a book. Whereas now, I was still wrong, but I have the medium and ability to go back to it. I was wrong. This is where I was wrong. What does this mean for December 10th? What does this mean for Gizbee? What does this mean for your platform? So that is a fear factor. And then number four, I think there is an aspect, yeah, maybe it deserves a treatment, but it's technically very much of the internet. And I think a nature of the internet is internet is transient. It's not permanent. Again, another thing people got wrong. I think actually one of the biggest mistakes Twitter made, and it's understandable. No one could have seen it at the time, but Twitter should have had disappearing tweets from day one. It should have always been a just in-the-moment social network. I think it would be a much better product. I don't think they would still do it now. People experience it and think of it as an in-the-moment product and then are stuck with this archive that induces fear, induces ruin, and it reduces the facade of what it's like to be on Twitter. That's a big reason why Twitter's not what it used to be, because now people are scared. Well, today you think that is fine. I think I could make this argument before, but articulating the way you have over the years and revising it on this process is actually a better product than if you were to have written a book five years ago. I'm like okay I'm on the board of a company and I'm trying to like explain to them that they need to resend their thinking and think about every usage area so I was like what's that I'm like I actually, again, it would be good to share and point to this thing and go read this. To be clear, I'm in the middle of massive self-reportation right now for explaining why this is the case. I take everything I'm saying with a grain of salt. And the other thing is I'm just having more fun and more interested in building software and figuring out podcasts. And I would like to think, oh, a book is just really about my ego and putting it out there. So I'm not that sort of person. I just want to give back the trick to you. That's why I said I'm definitely in recommendation mode. You're definitely in recommendation mode. But no, I should write a book. I just haven't. I don't know if I ever will. But I agree that I should have by now written a book. But alas. One last quick question on Andrew Jason Gage. I feel building up towards it, even if you said it's time to take it. What are the two years you're going to expect here before you wrote the first post? This is actually an example of the power of branding. I wrote articles that were basically allegation theory well before I wrote allegation theory. But giving it a term and pointing it is what made it stick. And actually, some of those articles that I wrote before, there's one I think it's called Economic Power in the Age of Abundance. It doesn't have the same ring to it. I think it's a better articulation of our area since I'm in my respect. I wrote it in 2014, I think. And yeah, number one, it doesn't have a good ring to it. Number two is one of my least read articles up to that date. Just no one got it or understood what I was talking about. And it's a weird thing as a writer. Like there's things that I'm thinking about now or that I know I will write about, but it's not the right time. It doesn't mean you just learn over time where you can be too early as a writer, too. This kind of goes back to I didn't know how to communicate. I remember I was in some media at Microsoft and we walked out and my manager was like, Ben, you're the only person in the room that actually understood the issue and what we should do. And absolutely everyone, no one understands what you're talking about and people are kind of annoying you. And he's like, the problem is we want to get to H, but everyone in that room is on A. And you cannot talk about H. You have to talk about B and then C. Is there? Is there? Yes. And it's funny that that applies to writing online, too. Number one, sometimes I'm wrong, so it's good to wait, or to be sort of sure. But number two, there's an aspect where there's just the right time and place for things. There's always stuff I'm sort of thinking about. And one thing I've learned is it's definitely better to write about something, a current event, which is bad from a book perspective, because I'll write an article that actually has some key insights that's talking about some events that happened in 2015 which no one remembers or cares about. But in the nature of my business, that is actually much better for helping people block it, get it, credit, share it, those sorts of things. So there is a bit where the incentives of my business do work against timeless pieces in a certain respect. Okay, so when you hit publish though on Andy Jason Keeley, did you think it could be what it became? I did know. You know, I thought about the name. Obviously, I was inspired by Clay Christensen Disruption Theory. That was sort of one of the things. But I had written a number of articles going up to that that were clearly building to that point. There's one about Airbnb. There's one about Netflix. There's one about just websites and publications. And then Arius' theory was sort of short and sweet because it was basically distilling what was in those pages articles into one thing. I felt very confident I had a thing and I wanted to have a definitive piece that was in what it was and needed to have a name. So that's what that was. For our last sponsor this episode, we are thanking our good friends at Tiny. Tiny is the virtual happening of the internet and has built and acquired the world's premier collection of truly wonderful internet businesses. Right now, you all know their story and can look into the story of the premier design agency in the entire world, Metal Lab, from its home in Victoria, British Columbia. Beautiful. Victoria, British Columbia. And he built the U.S. for Slack, Coinbase, Tinge, Headspace, Patreon, you name it, the best of the best. And then he and his partners became completely obsessed, just like us, with Richard Hathaway and Warren and Charlie, and they realized, later, there are a whole bunch of companies out there that are in that company who would be perfect birthday type companies that Warren and Tony are going to buy one because as we spent 10 hours talking about they don't get the internet, the client does. When they went out, they bought companies like Google, Pixelmuden, Creative Market, E20, Robots, Aeropress, among. Businesses doing $5 million or more in recurring revenue with 30% to 40% operating rises, but that otherwise was sort of stringing the asset to the technology industry because they either couldn't raise venture capital or even worse, they didn't raise venture capital, and then it turned out that there weren't M&A buyers for them and they didn't get to a steal all the requires for an IPO. Yeah, we're definitely in a situation now that the market has shifted where 90% of businesses already shouldn't raise venture capital, but 90% of the businesses that raise venture capital probably shouldn't have VUTA. So what do you do from here? Well, Tony has realized they can fix this situation for everybody. If you sell the company to them, the VCs can get the money back or whatever the appropriate amount of their money back is. Founders can take control back and set up an independent structure with Tiny that makes sense to keep growing their business, to keep pouring their energy into their life's work, and still have enough control over it with the right capital structure that actually makes sense for the type of business that they're in. They've done this with a bunch of businesses already this year. Venture-backed companies being over $5 million in revenue, 30% to 40% operating margins, or the potential for that to quickly become the case. And the most important thing is it removes the immense pressure on the business to get to an exit. And it just doesn't matter anymore. Tiny makes happy to own these businesses in perpetuity. And then I can tell you in my previous first as a professional capitalist and board member of many VC price companies, there are a lot of companies in VC portfolios that fit this bill. And it's just hard for them to do with these companies because they're making real products. They have customers. They have employees. But they're just not going to get to an outcome that makes sense for an acceptable frame. And so having an off-ramp like this is a god's end. If you're the founder of one of these businesses, if you're a VC board member of one of these businesses, don't let phone call scouting get the better of everyone. Recognize what the business potential actually is now that you have seen it. If it could be a profitable goal and concern, shoot a note to hi at tiny.com. I want to play a game where I give you a company and I'm curious, either if you were the CEO or you were giving advice to the CEO, what would you do strategically? And I think an interesting point, because we talked about it a bunch on this episode, is Meta. You are the new CEO of Meta. What do you do over the next five years? Well, I think Smeta is actually doing a fair number of things that they should. Now, the Apple changes were very devastating, and they're structurally devastating, and so they deserve a significant haircut under their way to because of that. But I also think they're remote enhancing in the long run, where I question whether any other company is ever going to build a top-of-the-funnel advertising product that will be competitive with Meta, assuming they didn't keep their audience. It appears that they've done a good job limiting the sort of TikTok threat. TikTok's growth has sort of flattened out over the last few years. So I think they're actually in good shape. What I do worry about is this is a company that's always been growing. It's really hard for those companies to shift to more of a scarcity questions. And obviously, any aggregator is dependent on having that audience. But I do think that the network effects of their products are still underrated. And everyone has in their head that they're shrinking, and actually every product they have is still growing, which I think is underprecuted. So number one, I think they're kind of probably on the right track. Number two, I would acquire Shopify, and I would take the FTCs as far as the court when they should stop it. I think they need to close the loop on e-commerce and advertising. And again, I think that's probably bad generally, but I think it would be very good for meta. So I would do that. As far as the metaverse stuff, I think it's a bad idea. It's very hard to talk about metaverse. Where are the prospects versus is it USYZ? I do think that it's not just a bad idea because it's taking so many resources and attention, I think, from Mark Zuckerberg, but also I just don't think innovation is necessarily born of mass expenditures in large companies. We sort of skipped over a period of experimentation and ecosystem building that in the long run perhaps would be consolidated into a couple companies, but it's just one monolith sort of trying to brute force this sort of bit. And the reality is that Facebook is a services company, it's a social network, and everything about their strategy works against that. To succeed, they not only need to sell headsets, they need to sell headsets at sufficient scale and into friend networks so that people can put some network on the prospects of this versus zooming out? Today, you're going to be doing this. But I think the market is overly down on Meta, in part because the company was too successful. This is still a powerhouse in social media and advertising. And the amount of money they're spending on the Metaverse is, all things considered, not that much. They still have a $5 billion profit a quarter. So yeah, I would double down on what they are, and I would consolidate Non-Aquire Shop to Buy and spend three years fighting out in court because I think the payoff would be worth it. All right, second one. Rather than going with another big American tech company, I want to go with one that's an acquired fan favorite and one that's very close to home to you, TSMC. Any change to what TSMC is doing now if you became CEO tomorrow? Not really. It's a very complicated situation, to say the least, for lots of reasons. I'm not just political, psychological. I think by doing what they're doing, probably it makes sense. Yeah, I don't know. I've read a ton about them and where they are. And you did talk about maybe some of the pricing stuff. They were pretty slow to raise prices, even in the face of shortages. They've been much more aggressive about that over the last little bit, which seems reasonable to me. It is opening the door for when and if a competitor comes along to undercut them in that regard. I think they're probably blessed by the weakness of their competition. But the long-term risk is obviously number one just a geopolitical risk. The reality is, is TSMC, a core to their model, essentially to the model of being so flexible, being so adaptive, of incorporating new equipment, of accommodating hundreds and hundreds of thousands of customers is all their engineering in one place. And that place is Taiwan and that has geopolitical risk. And from PSNC's perspective, I think that's just the reality. You can't really hedge against that. And so, if anything, yes, they're building these fabs in the U.S., I think largely for political reasons, and sort of do that if, you know, the economy feels that's super clear what's after that. How can you get smaller than one,? And you just have one nanometer. Yeah, there is visibility to under one. Isn't that two molecules wide? Or two atoms? It's very small. That service is quite that small. It's ridiculously small. So obviously I would imagine they're investing heavily. And they've been doing this, like advanced packaging, like multiple chips on the chipless sort of approach. AMD's doing that, Intel's not doing that. And getting really good at that stuff is going to be super important. Actually, one thing I do ask about the Japan investment is their twirling edge, I think their 28-anometer fabs, which is really where China is making a lot of progress because there's no real real economic reason to build trying-edge fabs. The whole idea is you build it once and it's long-term depreciation. You're still making money starting to keep chips out of that fab. But, I don't know, maybe there's something in the trying-edge. More things need chips, you don't need the leading edge. That's right. The economics of it are very difficult. I mean, the reality is that's why China can really make economically. You don't just jump to the leading edge. You have to sort of build your way up. And so China has a motivation and an economic rationale. And a lot of it's just the third manufacturing go right into products that are already in China. And so they're filling in that gap. You know, that's something that would be beneficial. But at the end of the day, you can see it's Taiwan. And that's going to always be the biggest risk. I'm not sure there's really much they can do about that. Okay, last one, Amazon. David and I did seven hours of Amazon.com and then a big AWS episode. I mean, that was my big takeaway. It is Day 2. And Day 2 is about becoming a profitable company where the big sell story tomorrow is realized today. And you've got to lean into that. And that means lots of changes in how they organize, you're like, I'm never going to become an old bogey like those old people. And then you get old like me and the people around you that are trying to still be young are just kind of pathetic. And actually being old is kind of great. My kids are fairly independent. They can take care of themselves. I can go out with friends. You know, obviously I have more means than I did when I was younger. And I'm a big advocate of just in general living in the present and embracing who you are and where you are at your life stage. And I think that's good personally. I think you're spot on. That's also true from a company perspective. You can't be a startup forever. And it's bad to. I wrote about from day two to one day or something about Amazon when Bezos sort of like reasserted control a few years ago. It was like, no, we're going to do one day delivery. And there's been too much time spent trying to squeeze our suppliers for profits and margins. And no, we need to get back to this. And in retrospect, that was the seed of Amazon's kind of disaster this last few years, which was they dramatically overinvested in their logistics network. Their cost structure got completely out of control. They overhired, and it's probably a good example, and maybe it was a precursor of what we saw with Jeff Bezos personally, of sort of losing track of where you are in life and what actually makes sense, and trying to be young forever. So I agree with you broadly with that bit about Amazon. Do you think that applies to AWS too or is that different? Realistically, the challenge for AWS is, number one, what's going to happen with the real dry up in startup formation and easy money in that space, a lot of which went to Amazon. They're sort of the default choice for startups. Number two, Microsoft sort of bread and butter has been, look, you've been working with us for a long time. We're going to package it at, like, somebody you're not just paying for on-premise Windows. It also includes Azure credits, and we're going to be able to contribute that to our numbers, and now you can sort of move pieces over, and we'll help you do it, which I think is exactly what it should do. It's been a very short strategy, but I think that the issue with any market is, it's like me, all the initial easy stuff is like there's lots of low-hanging fruit, but then the largest part of the market is still the part of the market that's sort of always been there and isn't necessarily fast-moving. And Microsoft is just really cleaned up in that market. We're the known entity. We can help you move over. And I think from Amazon building up the support capabilities and rationalizing their offerings, I mean, it's weird because Amazon benefits dependent on one of those features. And if that feature's not there, then they can't go away. And that actually ends up being their moat. We were researching the episode and we were talking to long-time AWS fans to sort of understand the mental framework, to talk about them today. And I think it's very clear that AWS doesn't deprecate features. It doesn't have to pull stuff, kill a fire phone, kill local deliveries, or food. They'll follow all kinds of stuff. But in AWS land, if a customer is depending on something, AWS's long-term enterprise value is determined by customers believing that Amazon will continue to support them forever. They don't deprecate services, even when those services end up flipping upside down on media economics, and they have to, like, name whom a costly service that they never figured out how to optimize. Right, and every time a customer does something custom-grade AWS, it's a lock-in, right? I mean, everyone sanitizes about this world where, you know, like, it all depends on whether it be, you know, containers or you have all these, you know, IBMs like talking about doing this when they acquire Red Hat. We're going to make it so you can be cloud-agnostic, right? Right. And then it just turns out that, well, cloud agnostic, but just one little piece of the, right? And then you wake up and, you know, of course, I want to be cloud agnostic. But Passport's not moving off AWS. I can promise you that. And so, yeah, it's the Microsoft strategy. Amazon has a lot of old Microsoft people in it. A ton. It's really interesting to consider like the different cultures between Seattle and San Francisco. Seattle just is a platform town. Like Microsoft was the originator. Microsoft's always been the best platform administrator. All that network compatibility that you want to make fun of from a user perspective is essential to building this foundation that people trust and that locks them in. And they're happy to be locked in because they don't want to go change it anyway, right? And Amazon doesn't share the US. Obviously, Microsoft is doing that with Azure. And the Silicon Valley companies are just very, very bad at town, right? Like, no one trusts Google, right? No one trusts Facebook. Silicon Valley is much more consumer-focused. Even the SaaS companies, those are consumerized enterprise technologies. Your whole idea is, don't worry, you never need to pay for an upgrade. We're upgrading on the back of ourself, but that means they will remove stuff because it's one thing to remove an API that a piece of software depends on versus removing a feature that you may assessors are annoyed, but it's not actually breaking what they operate on. It's just pretty interesting to see those differences with that. You think there's a geographic aspect to it. I mean, Java seems what saved Microsoft because when Microsoft was in the dumps, if they were in Silicon Valley, all their best talent would have left and not worked for other companies. But all their best talent had kids, they had families, they didn't want to work for Amazon. Those people are maniacs. And so they stayed at Microsoft. And they were miserable and they basically wrote snarky blog posts about the company. But then when Nadella came in and sort of refocused the company, they had this foundation of talent that the HPs of the world, the Yahoos of the world, had long since lost. Well, Ben, this has been awesome. Thank you for joining us and celebrating the almost 10-year anniversary of Stripecly with us. What is the easiest path for everyone who's right now is listening to this in a variety of podcast areas? Yeah, Spotify, Overcast, and Apple Podcasts. What is the easiest way for them to opt into the Stripecly universe? Well, if you go to Stripecly, you can click on the podcast on the side, you can describe. I mean, it's funny, like, how does the funnels work, right? Do you just go to Spectre and read and follow and I'll lure you in? Well, you go direct. We'll put a link in the show notes. Yeah, yeah. We use the show notes link. $12 a month, $120 a year, you not only get Spectre, but you also get the update, you get Spectre interviews. We didn't talk about interviews. That's actually been an interesting evolution of SEPHECTORY. Yeah, you're a primary source now. What's going on? Well, that was a challenge, right? Because I started out, I had no access, I didn't know anyone. And in some respects, I missed those days. I still remember the first time I had a company very angry at me and called me in, and it was Twitter actually, because I had teased out their results. Their direct response program was failing. This was like years ago. And they got super mad. In my next update, I'm like, well, there's possible this. And I kind of like walked it back a little bit. And the next quarter came out and they're like, yeah, we're going to need it. I don't know if it's going to go right now, but it was a big thing. And they were like, it's not working out. And I was totally right. And I was so mad that I kind of watch it back a little bit. But I'm glad it happened because when I started out, no one cared. No one paid any attention. Now people care and they're sort of paid attention. And so I'm glad I was right on that one. It just sort of gave me courage going forward. But what is interesting about feedback from companies is everyone like from COO down or VP down, they always push back. And they're like, no, you have to swall, you understand. I never get rotten incentive structure that's just inherent in incorporation. And so sometimes they know they have more information than I do. They're aware that there's things that I don't know, but they're grateful to have sort of a different point of view. And so over time, I prefer having no access to having total access, right? I can reach out to basically who haven't, let's just go through the lineup. You have this, you have Mark Zuckerberg on, you have Jensen for a video, you've had, I'm trying to figure out some of your early big ones. You just bought Melody Zillow, and I think he credited you with, you know, it's just important to me personally for my own pride that my takes are my takes. I'm not getting fed them from someone else. And so what I ended up going with was interviews. And part of this was a product bit. I had, now you can wish this to be a podcast. So if I had an interview, there's a good reason to try the product out, to get it. So there was a product angle. But also I'm like, my whole take is I'm not exclusive. I don't have exclusive information. What I'm selling is my personal analysis. And so if I'm talking to a CEO, I don't want the sense to be Ben's just parroting what a CEO says. So if the CEO wants to talk to me, it has to be on the record. And it's going to be the full transcript and the full interviews that are available to my subscribers. And I want my subscribers to have all the same information I do. And so when I write, it's me. It's coming out of my brain. It's pretty unique to me. And I think it's worked out pretty well. It's a change. Like instead of you like four days a week, I'm basically three days a week plus an interview. It's not just CEOs. I think actually often the better interviews are with like other analysts or people in different spaces. It's also solved the how do I cover startups because part of not being a reporter and being independent is public companies have to disclose a lot of data and they have earnings calls and they have presentations and things along those lines. With a startup, you don't have access to very much of that and you don't know how much is blowing smoke, how much is not. So now I am doing like interviewing founders where I say, look, this is completely subjective. I'm not going to verify what they say. I'm not going to do XYZ. It's no chance to tell their story, what their business is going to be, XYZ. And so that's a way to sort of cover that space given the limitations in the way Seppi operates. And so that's one of the products. It's not a standalone thing, which I think is better. It's still part of the Seppi. I thought about it should be a standalone product, but I think there's an aspect of I don't want there to ever be any sense that that's a driver of my bottom line. I want to be able to say that I think the metaverse is part of that idea. It's really tricky. I mean, though, Bart Zuckerberg won, obviously it's a huge gig. I think that his interviews with me are, I'm biased, but I think are right years better than he does anywhere else. You and Eli had the best interviews, you know, this whole last cycle. Right, he thinks I'm fair, whereas he thinks a lot of other journalists aren't. But what's the line between that and being like, you favor Facebook because that's not the case at all. Number one, it doesn't drive subscriptions. I always make them free, to be clear. No one's going to have to pay to get access to that because you shouldn't subscribe to Secretary because you want to read Mark Zuckerberg. That's not a reason. But then it was really annoying to Facebook had a bad earnings call and their sock went down. And I'm like, look everyone, my incentives are to have as many people subscribe for as long as possible. My incentive is not, I think I'm going to be Mark Zuckerberg's best friend, so I'm really hoping that he invites me on his p-day and we get to hang out. Yeah, well it's tough because I'm super positive on Meta's advertising product because that aligns my passion. So I do find Zuckerberg ones the most challenging just because I generally have a contrarian opinion about Meta overall and it's generally positive. So I'm super wary about that. I also feel like I get more interesting stuff out of him than most other interviewers. So I want to do that. And sure, it's a side of my cap to interview them. But I definitely don't want that to ever be perceived as, really, interviews don't drive subscriptions. And so I do it because, again, I want to push the tech product. I want to go to use my podcast product. And then it's a different kind of work. As you guys know, friends for interviews is a lot of work. It's also different than necessarily writing an article. Oh, for sure. You could not be ready. Yeah, you can't be the same forever. You can't be the startup forever, right? I can't be the guy on the outside forever, which I was when I started. With my tip on my shoulder, and I'm just some dude in Taiwan giving his opinions about Apple. That worked for me, and I'm not that person anymore. and be sort of dishonest to pretend that I am. The reality is, I probably have the best access to anyone in tech. I can literally contact basically anyone and get access to them. And it's more honest to my product and what I do to lean into that, I think, than to pretend it's not the case. All right. So, listeners, click the link in the show notes. Don't experience the spectacular cinematic universe, just a guy in Taiwan giving his opinion on Apple or probably locally. All right. With that, thank you to Fundrise, Pilot, and Tiny. After you finish this episode, come hang out in Slack with 13,000 other smart, kind, clever, curious members of the acquired community. Acquired.net.com slash Slack. This is sweet Acquired Merc. We now officially have live the ACQT. We've got to do a collab with Ben on acquired protecting features for the merch store. Oh, that's a good point. I have a protecting feature. I always wore it for recording this episode. I also have a framed aggregation theory. I don't want to stand by in front of Ben, but oh my gosh, I have a framed aggregation theory. So, I don't know, check out Ben for two. We'll put a link to that in the show notes. But the other great acquired merch that dropped a couple of weeks ago is the Benchmark key that did in Benchmark style. Of course, there's always room at the top. If you want to listen to the Acquired LP show and get more acquired crammed in for the holiday season, that's good stuff. Search the Acquired LP show in the podcast player of your show. And with that, we hope you have a wonderful holiday season. I believe there's still a whole more episode coming after this. There's still some special challenge. There's still a little fun holiday acquired type of stuff. Yeah. And with that, we'll see you next time. www.microsoft.com
